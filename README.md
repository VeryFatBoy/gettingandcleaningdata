Introduction
------------

This project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. A definition of tidy data can be found in this article by Hadley Wickham:

Background
----------
An exciting area in Data Science right now is wearable computing. A number of companies, such as Fitbit, Nike, and others are developing very advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used as input to this project represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A complete description is available at the site where the data were obtained:
